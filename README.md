## 1.add extra files

`extra` folder corresponding to the `electron-builder` files and `resources`. Copy files to the root directory and `resources` to `resources`

## 2.Debug

1. `main` - Break points are placed directly in the code in the main directory ï¼ŒUse vscode directly f5
2. `renderer`
   - Use devTools
   - react-dev-inspector is used to locate source code
   - reactDevTools It is enabled by default at development time. If it does not appear, refresh the console

## 3.Electron Builder

### 1.Config

The project uses json as the configuration, which provides a more flexible packaging, and you can add DEV before the property name to make different configurations for different environments.

> configFile: `electronBuilder.json`

## 4.scripts

```
"dev": No main process and preload hot reload
"dev:restart": Main process and preload hot reload
"build": build Main,Renderer,preload to release/app/dist
"pack:dev": No installation package is generated, and the asar is unpacked
```

## 5.Project usage library

css: pandaCss

store: electron-store

## 6.Coding

1. The preInit script located in the main process or the rendering process is used to perform some initialization operations. Do not execute code directly in the rest of the import script to avoid flow errors. For example, Preinit of the main process has a crash listener, which should be initialized as soon as possible, otherwise the previous problem will not be caught


## 7.Resource

### Image
`image` is located under the `assets` folder. uses vite to import resources. The resources used by the main process need to be placed in `assets/main`, for reasons explained later, and then the path is introduced in the form of the relative path `@assets/main/{file}`. 
 
> Because electron has its own processing of multiples, for example, logo.png and logo@2x.png are in the same directory, electron will use high-magnples on high-DPI devices. [NativeImage - Electron Doc] (https://www.electronjs.org/zh/docs/latest/api/native-image). So being in the build script will export the `assets/main` directory to the production folder.

## 8.known issue

1. When building js files with Vitess, there is a problem, and it is not recommended to use restart (hot restart) for development because the vendor or chunk is rebuilt every time and does not cache or have the preBuilt function during development. There is a dll plugin for webpack here, and the relevant plugins for Vite are yet to be investigated. If not, consider writing the relevant functions manually if the main process builds slowly.
